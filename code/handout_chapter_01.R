#' The genome of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana contains 33768 genes, 
#' of which 27655 are protein-coding and 6113 encode non-coding RNAs. 
#' Calculate the percentage of coding and non-coding genes in this genome 
#' using the following steps:
#' 
#' 
#' - Create a variable named `ath_genes` that stores the numeric value 33768.
#' 
#' - Create 2 objects named `n_coding` and `n_noncoding` that store 
#' the numeric values 27655 and 6113, respectively.
#' 
#' - Create 2 objects named `perc_coding` and `perc_noncoding` by dividing 
#' `n_coding` and `n_noncoding` by `ath_genes`.
#' 
#' - Update the objects by multiplying their contents by 100 (to represent 
#' in percentages, from 0 to 100) and rounding the percentages to 1 
#' significant digit only.

# Data frames ====








## Exercises ====

#' The plants Brussels sprout, grapevine and apple belong to the 
#' families Brassicaceae, Vitaceae, and Rosaceae. 
#' Create a data frame named `species_families` with 2 columns named 
#' `species` and `family` representing such information.
#' 







#' When you install R, it already comes with some example data sets. 
#' One of them is `airquality`, a data frame containing New York air 
#' quality measurements from May to September 1973. Inspect this data frame 
#' and answer the following questions:
#'     
#' 1. How many rows are there?
#' 2. How many columns are there?
#' 3. What are the column names?
#' 4. What are the classes of each column?

# Indexing and subsetting data frames






## Exercises ====

#' Subset the `airquality` data set to answer the following questions:
#' 
#' 1. How many days (rows) observations have ozone levels >40 ppb?
#' 2. How many days have wind speed between 10 and 15 mph?
#' 3. What are the minimum and maximum temperature?
#' 4. How many days have solar radiation <100 Langleys?
