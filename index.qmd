# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book aims to provide learners with a hands-on introduction to 
Computational Evolutionary Biology, and the materials here are used
in the practical lessons of the courses **C003709A - Evolutionary Biology**
and **C000500A - Bioinformatics 2** at Universiteit Gent, taught by 
Dr. Yves Van de Peer and Fabricio Almeida-Silva.

Each book chapter represents the contents of a practical lesson from the UGent
courses, and they serve both as a guide during the lessons and as a reference
to go back later.

The book will cover:

1. Introduction to the R programming language
2. Data structures for Evolutionary Biology in R
3. Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) and distance-based phylogeny inference
3. Maximum likelihood-based phylogeny inference
4. Analyses of gene and genome duplication
